   <p><i><b>The hosts file:</b>
A device's hosts file is used by the operating
system to store the correspondence between Internet
domains and IP addresses.  This is one of several
methods the operating system uses to resolve domain 
names. In the past, when there were no DNS servers
to resolve domains, the hosts file was the only one
in charge of doing it, but it stopped being used
when the number of domain names on the Internet
began to grow and then DNS resolution servers
were used.  In many operating systems this method
is used in preference to others such as DNS.
It is currently also used to block Internet content
such as web advertising.</i></p>
